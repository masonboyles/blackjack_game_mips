# poker_game_mips

I designed an entire CPU to process MIPS assembly instructions according to the following specifications. This was done over the course of a class I took called Digital Logic using System Verilog. These files were then used to generate a bitstream to run on a Nexys A7 FPGA.

Next, I created a blackjack game that utilizes I/O (keyboard, LED lights, sound, display, accelerometer). This was done in stages of conversion between Python to C and then C to assembly. Here is a demo of the final product running on a Nexys A7 FPGA.
